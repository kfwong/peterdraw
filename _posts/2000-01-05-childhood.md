Peter Draw (B.1984, Singapore) first fell in love with
drawing at the age of 3. At 6, he was kicked out of a drawing
workshop because he couldn't afford the fee. He ran home
believing that dreams do not come true for poor children like him.
His grandfather told him that dreams do come true if you believe
in yourself.

At 16 years old, his grandfather passed away. In tears, he learnt that our loved ones do not wait forever
for us. Peter decided to follow his dreams to draw and make others happy.
